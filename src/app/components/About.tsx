                    <span>Web developer and Software engineer, constantly evolving and currently seeking to enhance and continue advancing my professional career as a developer. Within web development, I work with technologies like Django, React, Next.js, Tailwind, Node.js, among others that you can see on my profile.</span>
                    <span>I recently worked at <b>FOUNDAXIS</b> as a junior software developer, where my main tasks were to integrate new software components using Svelte, Tailwind, and Figma. I also had the opportunity to create new endpoints and make changes to the backend models using Django and Python.</span>
                    <span>I am passionate about software development and algorithm building. I have always enjoyed puzzles in general and specifically have a great interest in Rubikâ€™s cubes. I am also a fan of the arts, such as music and photography, with the latter being what I enjoy the most.</span>
